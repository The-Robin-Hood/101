Welcome to 101. This is a collection of crazy and cool websites that i built. Each site will focus on a specific concept or technique in JavaScript, CSS, or HTML, and will be built from scratch using only these 

1. **index.html** - The HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
2. **style.css** - The CSS file that handles the styling of the webpage.
3. **script.js** - The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the webpage.

## Thumb Rule 

1. **Minimalism**: Each webpage will follow a minimalist design approach, focusing on simplicity and functionality without unnecessary elements.
2. **Vanilla JS**: No frameworks or libraries (like React, Vue, or Angular) will be used. However, libraries may be used for higher-level tasks if absolutely necessary.
3. **From Scratch**: As much as possible, all code will be written from scratch to ensure a deeper understanding of the concepts being taught.
